1. Project Overview

This project demonstrates a simple yet practical Identity Theft Detection & Prevention System implemented in Python. It simulates user logins, monitors suspicious activity, and raises alerts for potential identity theft. The goal is to connect technical implementation with legal, ethical, and professional responsibilities as covered in your lecture “Legal, Ethical, and Professional Issues in Information Security.”

2. Objectives

Detect and flag suspicious login behavior (failed login bursts, unusual locations, data export anomalies).

Demonstrate how organizations can apply due care and due diligence in information security.

Explain how these mechanisms relate to laws, regulations, and ethical practices in identity protection.

3. Technologies Used

Python 3.8+ (core language)

SQLite3 (lightweight local database)

Hashlib and HMAC (for secure password hashing)

Datetime and Time (for timestamps and monitoring windows)

No external dependencies are required — everything is built-in to Python.
